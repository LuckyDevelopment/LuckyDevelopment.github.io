## ‚≠ê About Me 
Hello! I have been coding for around **5** years now. I have experience in many languages, but I would say I've mastered only a couple, those being Lua, Luau, C#, and JavaScript.

I have expierence in other aspects of developing too, such as GFX, modeling, and some game design.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Information 

When writing code for your project, I prioritize quality. This means all code will have comments along with it, and use a modular framework to ensure compatability with other scripts in the future. No free assets will be used.

I am very fast at finishing commissions. I am a pretty fast typer (150 average wpm), and can write up what you need fast.

---

## üíª Experience

I've been coding for a while now, and I've mostly made systems. Not full fledged games. If you need a system for your game then I'm the perfect choice for you. I use a modular framework like Knit, and so I write professional code with not a ton of functions and random if statements. I've made:

- Vehicle Chassis
-  Backend and Frontend Systems
-  Was Head Developer of Roblox's biggest slot car group in 2024. (3k+ people)
-  Frameworks
-  Plugins
-  Helpful Utility Modules
-  Basically everything...

### What I will do: ‚úÖ

I will really do anything you need, as long as it is not a super small feature.

### What I will not/don't want to do: ‚ùå

Create a whole entire game for you. I do commissions to make profit, and working on one game for a long time that others don't care about is a **no** for me.

- Create combat systems.
- FPS Weapons
- Vehicle Systems
- Viewmodels

## üìΩ Past Projects (Not All)


#### RCS 2024 - Head Developer
I worked for Roblox's biggest slot car and meet group back in 2024. It was a great experience and I am still with them today.

They operate within in a discord server, so make sure to check that out.

I made multiple things for them, including part of a car system, global admin commands, spin the wheels, donation boards, loading screens, and a lot more.

#### Shake A Chest - Creator
A game where you shake a chest to unlock new look, buy better chests, and either profit or lose money. It is basically a gambling game where you try to gain the most value and profit possible.

#### Rooms Hardcore (Old) - Creator
A game based off of Doors, it was made a long time ago when I wasn't as good at coding but I got it to work.

#### Get some food at 3 am - Head Developer
Small game I worked on with a friend. I am the lead developer and have scripted every thing you see in this game. If you want to know what some of my work looks like, I would recommend joining this game.

Get some food at 3 am is heavily inspired from get a snack at 3 am. All assets and scripts are made by me.

#### Unnamed Commission - Scripter

I worked on rescripting a hangout game. Here is what I did.

- Nametag System
- Datastore and Leveling System
- Shop System
- VR System
- DJ System
- Gears

#### Global Voting Board - Scripter
I made a global voting board, which players can dislike or like a car, and you can just copy and paste thousands of boards to make more polls. A global leaderboard shows the top liked cars.

#### Media Board - Scripter
I made this media board, and it updates team rankings and you can add more teams to it.
